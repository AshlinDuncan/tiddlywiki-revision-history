title: $:/plugins/ashlin/revision-history/readme

This plugin adds the ability to automatically store and display revision history. It is dependent on a slight modification of the core to add an additional hook in navigator.js.

Every time you edit a tiddler, the plugin will create an internal copy of the previous tiddler. These revisions can be viewed through a new tab in the info panel.

If a tiddler is renamed, all of the previous revisions will be renamed to match. If the rename ends up overwriting an existing tiddler, the histories will be merged.

Currently, there is no limit on how many revisions can exist.
